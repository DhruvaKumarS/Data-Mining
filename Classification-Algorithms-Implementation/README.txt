KNN:
-Copy knn.py and the required dataset files into the same directory.
-Run the script as follows:
	python3 knn.py <path_to_input_dataset> <value_of_k>  
-path_to_input_dataset corresponds to the dataset on which you want to run this script on.
-value_of_k corresponds to the number of nearest neighbors/candidates that will be considered during every run for classification
-Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-Measure are printed upon completion of the script to depict the various metrics on which the script was evaluated on

Decision-Tree:
